## Project Focus Hierarchy

### 1. PRIMARY: tkr-docusearch
**Positioning:** Hero project - demonstrates AI UX innovation at scale
**Why Primary:** Shows complete UX process from problem discovery through shipped solution
**Content Allocation:** 40-50% of portfolio real estate
**Voice/Tone:** Confident, process-focused, outcome-driven

**Key Materials:**
- [Full Case Study](./docusearch_portfolio_case_study.md) - Comprehensive project walkthrough
- [Elevator Pitch](./docusearch_elevator_pitch.md) - 30-second version
- [Talking Points](./docusearch_talking_points.md) - Interview/discussion guide
- [Visual Walkthrough](./docusearch_visual_walkthrough.md) - Image selection and captions

**What to Emphasize:**
- Problem space (library/framework documentation search challenges)
- User research methodology
- Information architecture decisions
- Search system design
- Dual interface thinking (human visual UI + agent structured data)
- Real-world usage and impact

---

### 2. SECONDARY (VITAL): tkr-context-kit
**Positioning:** Innovation showcase - AGx design methodology demonstration
**Why Vital:** Unique differentiator, demonstrates thought leadership in emerging field
**Content Allocation:** 30-35% of portfolio real estate
**Voice/Tone:** Exploratory, research-focused, slightly more technical

**Key Materials:**
- [Full Case Study](./tkr-context-kit_case_study.md) - Complete narrative
- [Elevator Pitch](./tkr-context-kit_elevator_pitch.md) - Quick explanation
- [Portfolio Snippet](./tkr-context-kit_portfolio_snippet.md) - Condensed version

**What to Emphasize:**
- Agent Experience (AGx) research methodology
- "User research with AI agents" - direct agent feedback
- `_project.yml` semantic architecture
- 70% token reduction through YAML semantic anchors
- Progressive disclosure design pattern
- Service-oriented architecture thinking
- **Supporting role to docusearch** - infrastructure that enables primary work

**Narrative Connection:**
Position context-kit as the **tooling infrastructure** that supports your primary UX work. Show it as evidence of system-level thinking and willingness to build tools when existing solutions fall short.

---

### 3. TERTIARY: tkr-kanban
**Positioning:** Supporting evidence - dual interface validation
**Why Tertiary:** Demonstrates traditional UX chops, validates dual interface concept
**Content Allocation:** 15-20% of portfolio real estate
**Voice/Tone:** Practical, problem-solving, collaborative

**Key Materials:**
- [Full Case Study](./tkr-kanban_case_study.md) - Complete story
- [Elevator Pitch](./tkr-kanban_elevator_pitch.md) - Quick version
- [Portfolio Snippet](./tkr-kanban_portfolio_snippet.md) - Condensed format

**What to Emphasize:**
- Dual interface design (visual board + spec files)
- Traditional UX process (research, iteration, testing)
- Practical problem-solving
- Collaborative development workflow

**Narrative Connection:**
Use kanban as **proof of concept** for dual interface thinking that informed both docusearch and context-kit approaches. Shows you've been exploring this pattern across multiple projects.

---

## Cross-Project Narrative Thread

### The Unifying Theme: Dual Interface Design
All three projects demonstrate variations on the same core innovation:

1. **tkr-kanban:** Humans use visual board, agents read/write spec files
2. **tkr-docusearch:** Humans search visually, agents consume structured documentation
3. **tkr-context-kit:** Humans read markdown, agents parse YAML context maps

**Portfolio Message:** "I design systems where humans and AI agents work with the same information, each through interfaces optimized for their needs."

---

## Content Structure Strategy

### Homepage/About (150-250 words)
- One-liner hook
- Brief background (creative → UX → AGx)
- Three-layer positioning:
  1. Traditional UX skills
  2. AI UX innovation
  3. System-level thinking

### Project Presentation Order
1. **docusearch** - Lead with strength
2. **context-kit** - Follow with innovation
3. **kanban** - Close with validation

### Depth Strategy (Apply Tucker's 3-layer approach)
- **One-liner** - Tweet-length essence (all projects)
- **Elevator pitch** - 30-second version (all projects)
- **Full case study** - Depth for interested readers (docusearch, context-kit)
- **Portfolio snippet** - Medium depth (kanban)

---

## Voice & Style Application

### All Content Must Follow
Reference: [Tucker Voice & Style Playbook](./tkr-voice-style-playbook.md)

**Core Framework:** Problem → Understanding → Solution → Impact

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Direct and practical
- Conversational but professional
- Show process over polish
- Use "I" statements showing ownership
- Concrete examples over abstract claims

**Sentence Starters (Tucker favorites):**
- "I created..."
- "This led me to..."
- "I noticed..."
- "The key insight was..."
- "What I learned..."

---

## Supporting Materials

### Quick Reference Documents
- [Portfolio Quick Reference](./portfolio_quick_reference.md) - At-a-glance overview
- [Three Project Narrative](./portfolio_narrative_three_projects.md) - Unified story arc

### Content Guidelines
All portfolio content must reference and adhere to:
- [Voice & Style Playbook](./tkr-voice-style-playbook.md)
- Problem → Understanding → Solution → Impact framework
- Tucker's 3-layer depth approach
- "Show, don't tell" principle
- Process over polish philosophy

---

## Key Differentiators to Maintain

### Unique Positioning Elements
1. **"User research with AI agents"** - Literally ask Claude what works best
2. **Dual interface design pattern** - Same data, different interaction modes
3. **AGx design methodology** - Treating agents as users worth studying
4. **Context architecture** - Information design for agent consumption
5. **Creative background as credential** - Songwriting/podcasting as communication skills

### Skills Demonstration Across Projects
- **Traditional UX:** User research, stakeholder interviews, iterative design (all projects)
- **AI UX Innovation:** Agent feedback, dual interfaces, context optimization (docusearch, context-kit)
- **Technical Depth:** Full-stack implementation, architecture design (context-kit, kanban)
- **Communication:** Documentation, distillation, storytelling (all projects)

---

## What to Avoid

❌ **Do Not:**
- Lead with technical implementation details
- List tools/software proficiency without context
- Use buzzwords without explanation
- Claim metrics we don't have
- Make it about tools instead of thinking
- Position as "just documentation" (it's information architecture)
- Separate "traditional UX" from "AI UX" (it's all UX for different users)

✅ **Always:**
- Show the work and process
- Use concrete examples
- Emphasize insights and learnings
- Connect creative background to UX thinking
- Position AI agents as users deserving thoughtful design
- Demonstrate system-level thinking
- Keep Tucker's conversational voice throughout
