Tucker Portfolio Style Guide & Playbook
Voice & Tone
Core Personality

Direct and practical - Gets to the point without unnecessary flourish
Conversational but professional - "Tucker" casual, not "corporate speak"
Confident without being arrogant - Shows expertise through examples, not claims
Collaborative - Emphasizes working with people/agents, not just for them

Voice Characteristics

Uses "I" statements showing personal ownership
Active voice over passive ("I designed" not "was designed by")
Short, punchy sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones
Rhetorical questions used sparingly for engagement
Avoids buzzwords unless genuinely meaningful

Examples of Tucker's Voice
✅ Good (Tucker's style):

"I solve big problems in small ways—creating software people love to use."


"My background in stakeholder interviews taught me how to uncover user mental models."


"I've been conducting 'user research' with AI agents—asking them what context formats work best."

❌ Avoid (Too corporate):

"Leveraging synergistic stakeholder engagement methodologies, I deliver impactful solutions."


"My approach utilizes best-in-class research frameworks to optimize user experiences."


Content Structure Principles
The Tucker Framework: Problem → Understanding → Solution → Impact
Every project/section follows this narrative arc:

Problem/Context - What pain point exists? (1-2 sentences)
Understanding - How did you investigate? (Process focus)
Solution - What did you create? (Concrete, visual)
Impact - What changed? (Qualitative > Quantitative when metrics unavailable)

Sentence Structure Patterns
Opening hooks:

Statement of philosophy: "I solve big problems..."
Observation: "I noticed AI agents were spending too much time..."
Question answered: "How do you design for users who can read 10,000 words instantly?"

Body paragraphs:

Start with topic sentence
Support with 1-2 specific examples
End with insight or transition

Transitions between sections:

Bridge with "This led me to..." / "This experience shaped..."
Connect old work to new: "The same principles apply to..."
Use questions: "But what about users who aren't a person?"


Content Strategy
What to Emphasize
Core Skills (Traditional UX):

Stakeholder immersion and interviews
User research and mental model discovery
Iterative design with feedback loops
Cross-functional collaboration

Differentiators (AI UX):

"User research with AI agents"
Dual interface design (same data, different interaction modes)
Conversational systems design
Context architecture for agent consumption

Supporting Credentials:

Podcast production (communication, storytelling, distillation)
Off-Hours Creative course (breaking down complexity)
Songwriting background (concept distillation, storytelling)

What to Downplay/Avoid

❌ Overly technical implementation details
❌ Extensive code samples (unless it shows UX thinking)
❌ Jargon without explanation
❌ Listing tools/software proficiency
❌ Metrics we don't have


Storytelling Techniques
The "Songwriting as Storytelling" Method
From Off-Hours Creative course, applied to UX writing:

Hook - Start with the core problem in one memorable line

Example: "Agents were re-learning my project structure in every conversation"


Verse/Detail - Develop the context with specific details

Example: "I watched Claude spend 8-12 seconds searching for component files..."


Chorus/Insight - Return to the central truth/solution

Example: "This led to the _project.yml approach: give agents comprehensive context upfront"


Bridge/Evolution - Show how understanding deepened

Example: "But YAML alone wasn't enough. The agents told me they preferred..."


Resolution - Land on the impact/change

Example: "Now conversations start with full context. No more re-exploration."



Distilling Complexity
Tucker's 3-layer approach:

One-liner (Tweet-length essence)

"I design systems where people and AI collaborate naturally"


Elevator pitch (30-second version)

"I create dual interfaces. People interact visually, AI agents work with data files, but they're both working with the same information. This means a person can drag-and-drop while agents can analyze and update simultaneously."


Full explanation (When they want details)

Complete project case studies with process, decisions, and outcomes



Use this layering in content:

Lead with the one-liner
Expand to elevator pitch in intro paragraph
Deep dive only for readers who want it


Visual Content Strategy
Image Selection Priorities

Process over polish - Show the work, not just final designs

Sketches, whiteboards, iteration notes
"Before/After" comparisons
Decision-making artifacts


Context over beauty - Explain why not just what

Annotations showing thinking
Callouts highlighting key decisions
Problem/solution juxtaposition


Real over staged - Authentic work examples

Actual project files
Screenshots with real data
Photos from actual sessions



Caption Style
Format:
[Image]
Brief description of what's shown (1 sentence)
Why it matters (1 sentence)
Example:
Discovery session notes showing customer success team interview findings.
This research revealed which metrics mattered most for debugging live streams.

Tucker's Rules to Remember

Show, don't just tell - Every claim needs an example
Process over polish - Explain the thinking, not just the output
User-first, even for AI - AI agents are users too
Collaboration is key - Never "I did everything" tone
Iteration is natural - Show evolution, not perfection
Concrete over abstract - Specific examples beat vague descriptions
Casual but credible - Professional without being stiff
Impact matters - What changed because of the work?


Quick Reference: Tucker's Communication Formula
Problem (pain point) 
→ Investigation (how I understood it)
→ Insight (what I learned)
→ Solution (what I created)
→ Impact (what changed)
Apply this at every level:

Overall portfolio structure
Individual project sections
Even within paragraphs when appropriate
