## Key Talking Points by Project

### DocuSearch
**One-liner:** "I designed a document search system where humans browse visually while AI agents search semantically—both working with the same files."

**Differentiator:** Multi-modal embeddings + dual interfaces + source verification

**Stats to reference:**
- 15 days, 207 commits
- 21 document formats
- Sub-second semantic search
- 98% test coverage

**Best for:** Demonstrating production AI UX capabilities

---

### TaskBoardAI
**One-liner:** "I designed a kanban board where humans drag cards visually while AI agents edit JSON files—both working with the same tasks naturally."

**Differentiator:** File-based architecture + MCP integration + card-first design

**Best story:** Markdown frustration → dual-interface discovery → dogfooding validation

**Best for:** Showing dual-interface design thinking and problem-solving

---

### tkr-context-kit
**One-liner:** "I designed a context system that gives AI agents comprehensive project understanding upfront—eliminating 20-30% of every conversation spent on context discovery."

**Differentiator:** AGx research methodology + semantic anchors + progressive disclosure

**Key innovation:** _project.yml with semantic anchors reduced from ~1000 to ~300 lines

**Best for:** Demonstrating Agent Experience research and information architecture

---

## The Progression Story

**Use this narrative when discussing your portfolio:**

"I started with TaskBoardAI, solving a personal problem with markdown to-do lists. The real discovery was that humans and AI agents need different interfaces to the same data.

That led me to tkr-context-kit, where I went deeper—conducting systematic research with AI agents about how they consume information. I developed semantic anchors and progressive disclosure patterns specifically for agent efficiency.

DocuSearch synthesizes everything—combining dual interfaces, context architecture, and multi-modal understanding into a production system. It represents the evolution from traditional UX to Agent Experience design."

## What Makes Your Portfolio Unique

### The Differentiator: Agent Experience (AGx) Design

Most UX portfolios show traditional user research and interface design. Yours demonstrates:

1. **Systematic research with AI agents as users**
2. **Dual-interface design patterns** (humans + agents simultaneously)
3. **Information architecture specifically for AI consumption**
4. **Production implementation** (not just concepts)
5. **Measurable impact** (token reduction, time savings, consistency)

### The Progression Story

Your three projects show clear growth:
- **Discovery** (TaskBoardAI): Agents have different needs
- **Research** (context-kit): Systematic AGx methodology
- **Production** (DocuSearch): Applied at scale with polish

This demonstrates both innovation and execution—you're pioneering a new field while shipping production code.
